<h2>Schrodinger Equation in 1D</h2>
This simulation solves the time dependent Schrodinger equation for one dimension. To open it download all the files as a zip ('clone or download' when you are in the folder called quantum). Then open schrodinger.html in any browser (that is not internet explorer). The long axis is the x-axis and the shorter axes represent the real and imaginary parts of the wave function. The simulation technique is rather simple so you might see some artifacts for some combinations of wave function and potential  (sine + harmonic oscillator, sine + finite square well). *Press 'reset' to update changes made in the options*. You can zoom by scrolling and pan by right-click + drag. Play with the simulation and answer these questions for yourself.

Set the simulation to Wavepacket + Infinite square well.
The wavefunction tends to rotate either clockwise or anti-clockwise in space, like a corkscrew. What does the orientation of the wave function say about the direction of movement? What happens when the wave function is flat? With flat I mean the wavefuntion doesn't rotate like a corkscrew, which happens when the particle is near the edges. The wave function tends to spread over time. Which observable measures the spread of the wave function?

Set the simulation to Sine(?) + Infinite square well.
With Sine(?) I mean either Sine1, Sine2 or Sine1 + Sine2. The sine solutions move really slowly, why do they move so slow? You can use E=h*f for this. How much faster does the Sine2 solution move with respect to Sine1? Or phrased differently, what do you get when you divide the frequency of Sine2 by the frequency of Sine1? Now set the display to |psi|^2, which you know as probability density. Sine1 and Sine2 are stationary states, why? Why is Sine12 not a stationay state?

Which potential makes the gaussian stationary? Note: it is not actually the proper eigenstate, I just changed the parameter of the gaussian until it was kind of stationary.

Set the simulation to Wavepacket + Harmonic Oscillator
Think about the rotation mentioned earlier. Why does the rotation rate (in space) slow down as the particle moves from the middle? Set the display to |Psi|^2. Does what you see make intuitive sense?

Set the simulation to Sine(?) + Finite square well
The simulation is a bit wavy because I used a cut-off sine instead of the eigenstates of the finite square well. Can you spot where the well ends? Just from observation, is the energy of these states higher or lower than the well? The edges of the sine wave look quite smooth, which function describe these edges?
